# Home Counters Management Application

Welcome to the Home Counters Management Application! This Django project was developed as the capstone project for the
CS50 Web Programming Course. The application enables users to efficiently track and
manage various home counters, such as hot-water, electricity, cold-water, and more. Users can add their own counters,
set monthly payments, specify payment per-unit consumption (e.g., kWh for electricity or m3 for water), and monitor
usage trends. The application facilitates accurate monthly payment calculations and provides a detailed overview of
consumption and payment history. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing
counter details, recording readings, and calculating accurate monthly payments based on consumption.

## Key Features

- Multiple Counter Types: Add and manage different types of home counters, including hot-water, electricity, gas,
  cold-water, and more. The application is designed to be flexible and allows users to customize counter types to their
  specific needs.
- Payment per-Unit Consumption: Specify the price per-unit consumption (e.g., kWh, m3) for each counter. The application
  automatically calculates the total payment based on the consumed units, ensuring accurate billing.
- Usage Monitoring and Trend Analysis: Record readings for each counter periodically, and the application tracks and
  displays consumption patterns over time. Users can analyze usage trends and identify any inefficiencies or unusual
  patterns.

## Project Complexity and Distinctiveness

The Home Counters Management Application stands out due to its comprehensive set of features, such as customizable
counter types, accurate payment calculations, usage monitoring, and separate editing options. The application's
complexity lies in handling multiple counter scenarios and providing a user-friendly interface for tracking and managing
home counters efficiently.

This project was developed as part of a larger initiative to help users manage their home resources effectively, make
informed decisions about their usage patterns, and optimize their monthly expenses.
